# Optimizing Agentic Workflows with RL and Trajectory-Based Approaches

The recent excitement around Deepseek's R1 model—known for achieving best-in-class reasoning without relying on traditional methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)—has inspired us to rethink how we design agentic workflows. By eliminating the usual computational complexity of reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, R1 introduces a more efficient and streamlined approach. This has prompted us to explore how similar model-specific design choices can be applied to optimize AI agents for dynamic, multi-step tasks.

## Leveraging RL-Inspired Mechanisms

Our approach aims to build on the success of Deepseek's R1 model by integrating key reinforcement learning (RL) principles while drawing inspiration from the model's architectural innovations. Rather than relying on computationally expensive iterative optimization loops, we selectively incorporate:

- **Reward modeling** to guide agent behavior
- **Exploration-exploitation trade-offs** to optimize decision-making
- **Policy refinement** to ensure adaptability

We seek to elaborate on our approach by selectively incorporating RL-inspired mechanisms—such as reward modeling, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and policy refinement—while avoiding the heavy reliance on iterative optimization loops. Instead, we aim to leverage R1’s architectural choices, including its focus on structured latent space representations and state spaces, to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of our agentic workflows.

Instead of heavy reinforcement learning, we focus on **structured latent space representations** and **state-space optimization** to enhance agentic workflows.

## Our Development Journey

While large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning capabilities, they often struggle with practical execution in real-world workflows. Our experience in applying AI agents to business scenarios revealed recurring challenges, including:

- Agents getting stuck in looping patterns
- Complex reasoning steps leading to inefficiencies
- Lack of contextual awareness in multi-step tasks

To address these issues, we take a **bootstrapped approach**, similar to how a junior employee seeks guidance from an experienced colleague. By leveraging past insights, best practices, and structured decision-making, our agents can make more informed choices, avoiding unnecessary loops and inefficiencies.

## Defining an Agentic Language: The RL 5-Tuple

Before optimizing agentic workflows, we needed a structured way to define an agent's state, decisions, and actions. Traditional RL uses a **5-tuple** representation:

To improve efficiency, we refined this approach by encoding the agent's environment as a **(state, tool, task)** tuple. This provides a structured way to align agent actions with business objectives, ensuring efficient tool usage.

## Monte Carlo Simulations: Strengths and Weaknesses

One possible approach to optimizing agentic workflows is to apply a method akin to **Monte Carlo simulations**, where we would explore the entire state-action space by randomly sampling various combinations of states and actions, running multiple simulations, and then analyzing the results to identify the most optimal paths. However, this approach exhibits significant drawbacks:

- **Computationally expensive**: Large state-action spaces require extensive processing.
- **Suboptimal solutions**: Random exploration may lead to impractical or inefficient paths.
- **Inefficient for real-time decision-making**: Delays in processing make it unsuitable for business-critical applications.

Its worth noting at this point that in the context of agentic workflows, the actions would be the various tools available to the agent. This method could provide a broad understanding of potential outcomes by capturing a diverse range of possibilities and measuring the results to find the best strategies or decisions for the agent. By performing numerous trials, we could theoretically uncover optimal behaviors across a wide set of scenarios, improving the agent’s ability to adapt to dynamic, real-world conditions.

However, while this approach may sound promising and intuitive, it has several significant drawbacks, particularly in the context of business-critical applications. Monte Carlo simulations are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with a large and complex state-action space. The sheer volume of simulations required to cover all potential combinations could lead to prohibitively long processing times, reducing the practicality of this approach for real-time decision-making. 

Like exhaustive exploration, this method could lead to unintended side effects such as discovering suboptimal or impractical solutions, which may not align with broader business objectives or may even disrupt operational workflows. In summary, while Monte Carlo simulations offer a broad, exploratory view of the problem space, their application in business-critical systems could be both inefficient and risky, highlighting the need for a more focused, goal-oriented optimization approach.

# **Trajectory-Based Optimization in SAT: A SARSA-Inspired Approach**

Our **State-Action-Tool (STR) framework** builds on the principles of the **SARSA reinforcement learning (RL) framework**, but instead of generic state-action updates, we integrate **agent tools** and capture **successful trajectories**—defined as sequences where tasks set by humans are successfully completed. These trajectories are then stored in a backend database, allowing agents to refine their decision-making processes over time.

# Trajectory-Based Optimization in SAT: A SARSA-Inspired Approach

Our State-Tool-Reward (STR) framework extends the principles of the SARSA reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Unlike traditional state-action updates, SAT integrates agent tools and captures successful trajectories—sequences where human-defined tasks are completed successfully. These trajectories are stored in a backend database, allowing agents to continuously refine their decision-making processes over time.

## What is a Trajectory?

In SAT, a trajectory is a structured sequence of tuples (state, action, tool) that models an agent’s progression through its workflow. Unlike the random exploration of the state-action space seen in traditional Monte Carlo methods, SAT defines structured paths that guide decision-making. These trajectories focus exploration on achieving business-relevant objectives.

By mapping out these trajectories, we can systematically analyze how different sequences lead to either successful or suboptimal outcomes. This approach allows for informed decision-making without the need for exhaustive computation.

### Heuristic-Guided Pruning

To optimize these trajectories, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) principles, allowing agents to learn from past experiences and improve decision-making. Unlike Monte Carlo simulations, which rely on extensive random sampling, RL techniques like policy gradient methods and Q-learning enable agents to prioritize high-reward actions while minimizing unnecessary exploration. By assigning rewards to trajectories that align with key performance indicators (KPIs), we ensure that agents optimize their workflows in a goal-oriented manner.

Another refinement is **heuristic-guided pruning**, where we eliminate low-value trajectories to focus on the most promising pathways. Leveraging domain expertise and historical data, we can preemptively discard impractical routes, reducing computational complexity while preserving strategic flexibility. For example, if a particular tool consistently results in poor outcomes in certain states, it can be deprioritized or excluded from future explorations.

## Adaptive Trajectory Optimization

To ensure adaptability, we incorporate Bayesian optimization and Thompson Sampling into the trajectory selection process. These probabilistic methods help the agent balance exploitation—following known high-performing trajectories—with exploration—testing new pathways that may yield better results. This adaptive approach enables the agent to remain resilient in dynamic environments while continuously improving its efficiency.
